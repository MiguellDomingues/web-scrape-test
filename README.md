# web-scrape-test

usage:

'npm install' to add dependencies

'node scraper/init.js' to run

this will scrape all products from ezvape.com/surreyvapes.com/thunderbirdvapes.com and save them into .json files inside /scraper/inventories

you may want to avoid scraping ezvape since it takes like 10 minutes to finish. just comment out line 12 in init.js
